#' @details:
#'
#' Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and
#' public health potential of pathogen genome data. They provide a
#' continually-updated view of publicly available data alongside
#' powerful analytic and visualization tools for use by the
#' community. Their goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and
#' improve outbreak response.
#'
#' @section Nextstrain overview:
#' From the Nextstrain website:
#'
#' In the course of an infection and over an epidemic, pathogens
#' naturally accumulate random mutations to their genomes. This is an
#' inevitable consequence of error-prone genome replication. Since
#' different genomes typically pick up different mutations, mutations
#' can be used as a marker of transmission in which closely related
#' genomes indicate closely related infections. By reconstructing a
#' phylogeny we can learn about important epidemiological phenomena
#' such as spatial spread, introduction timings and epidemic growth
#' rate.
#'
#' However, if pathogen genome sequences are going to inform public
#' health interventions, then analyses have to be rapidly conducted
#' and results widely disseminated. Current scientific publishing
#' practices hinder the rapid dissemination of epidemiologically
#' relevant results. We thought an open online system that implements
#' robust bioinformatic pipelines to synthesize data from across
#' research groups has the best capacity to make epidemiologically
#' actionable inferences.
