# Background and Motivation

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of
International concern (PHEIC) and within six weeks had characterized
the outbreak as a pandemic. Compared to the 2003-2004 severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) PHEIC, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading
more quickly and with a much higher death toll. However, the current
pandemic is occurring in a more digital and interconnected world.
Traditional public health organizations as well as data-mature
organizations not traditionally involved directly in public health
have rapidly developed digital disease surveillance infrastructuree
that provides nearly realtime epidemic tracking data. These data
resources have proven invaluable to understanding disease spread, to
drive non-pharmacologic intervention (NPI), and, when combined with
additional data resources, to project impacts to communities and
healthcare systems around the world. Even as the urgency of the
initial "hammer" of the COVID-19 pandemic begins to abate, the need
for timely, robust, and granular datasets will inform business,
policy, and even personal decisions for months or even years to
come.

1. Collect and provide principled approach to COVID-19 epidemic
   dataset reuse.
2. Capitalize on the large, existing multidisciplinary data science
   workforce already familiar with the R programming environment.
3. Create opportunities for individuals not well-versed in data
   science to learn and experiment with COVID-19 datasets.
4. Incorporate examplar workflows that leverage the extensive R data
   science ecosystem to visualize, analyze, and integrate COVID-19
   data resources. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented and sometimes
hard-to-predict changes to our daily lives. In the midst of this
change and uncertainty, observational data resources form the backbone
of national and international efforts to understand the spread of the
disease and to mitigate its impact on communities and nation states.
The sars2pack adopts a principled approach to deliver tested and
documented code and data resources.

# Methods

We collected openly available data resources for inclusion in the
package, focusing on regularly updated datasets that tracked the
spread of disease, the impact of disease on the healthcare system and
communities, or that quantified or cataloged non-pharmaceutical
interventions. To be included, the data resource needed to be openly
accessible with data in a computationally readable format such as csv,
json, or Excel. The set of collected datasets is available in TABLE
XXXXX.

## Robustness

Standard unit testing ensures that existing functionality remains in
the midst of ongoing changes and the addition of new features. All
datasets are checked each day using automated integration
testing. Details such as the number, type, and names of columns are
checked against exported norms with developers and interested users
receiving detailed notifications of failures. Higher-level

## Usability

The sars2pack is accessible to anyone with a working R installation
using standard R package installation processes. To enhance
portability, we offer an updated Docker (REF) image. Finally, to
minimize barriers for “trying it out,” a one-click launch mechanism
that leverages Binder (mybinder.org REF) results in a fully-functional
web-based development environment suitable for accessing all currently
available datasets. Online documentation that includes workflows,
dataset overview and details, and didactic materials serve to augment
R function documentation (GITHUB PAGES).

In a mix of both defined facts and uncertainty, open data science
helps clarify possible outcomes of interventions, and opens a path to
sharper understanding as facts harden in various domains.

COVID-19: Responses from the perspective of open data science

1) Audience: data scientists and their supporters

2) Message: In a mix of hard and uncertain facts, open data science helps clarify possible outcomes of interventions, and opens a path to sharper understanding as facts harden in various domains

Overview on facts and uncertainties: a) When was "patient zero" infected, for the pandemic as a whole and for outbreaks in specific localities?  b) What are the incubation period, serial interval, latent period, period of communicability, modes of transmission of SARS-Cov-2? c) What are the rates of transition between infection, symptoms, death, and how do factors at levels of host, pathogen, and environment affect these? d) what are the actual transmission dynamics in human societies and which health systems are best suited to defining them?  e) What non-pharmacologic interventions (NPI) have been used for the 2020 pandemic, where and when were they implemented, and what have their effects been?  How can inference on NPI effects be properly protected from bias due to confounding, measurement error, and other threats to validity?  

The Lipsitch NYT Op-Ed piece on immunity is a good collection of open questions to be addressed through observation, experiment and data analysis.  The Santa Clara seroprevalence report uses a structured sample of 3300 residents to obtain weighted estimates of prevalence of antibodies to SARS-Cov-2.  The UT study of mobility data for assessing social distancing implementation for incidence projection provides a quantitative representation of dynamic social distancing processes.

Objectives of data science in this context: Once a problem is clearly formulated, identify data features that contribute to its solution, derive the solution and present it in the context of remaining uncertainty.  Respond to changes in problem formulation and data resources, updating solutions and uncertainty measures.

Coordination of data science: Can researchers "divide and conquer" the large collection of problems underlying analysis and response to pandemic spread of possibly highly lethal pathogens?

Application of data science: Can policymakers and scientists responsible for policy guidance and administration of new investigations rapidly consume and interpret data patterns and inferences to drive social and government responses towards cost-effective responses?

## Facts addressible with sars2pack

a) official reporting of COVID-19 incidence over time, gathered from self-organized aggregators
b) government policy responses over time, collected at Oxford/Blavatnik (International) and U Washington (Social distancing)
c) health care system capacity, collected at Kaiser Health Network and healthdata.org
d) mobility data in US, collected at Descartes Labs
e) Projections of disease morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization
